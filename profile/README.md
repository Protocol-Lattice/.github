# Protocol Lattice

Building open infrastructure for AI systems.

## What We Do

Protocol Lattice develops open standards and tools for AI interaction, memory, and tooling. We focus on practical implementations that enable different AI systems to work together effectively.

## Our Approach

We prioritize:
- **Clear specifications** over abstract theory
- **Working code** over comprehensive roadmaps  
- **Real-world adoption** over feature completeness
- **Community input** over top-down design

## Open Source

Everything we build is open source. We write documentation that helps developers implement and extend our work. Our goal is to create tools that remain useful and maintainable over time.

## Get Involved

If you're working on AI infrastructure, implementing our protocols, or interested in collaborating, we'd like to hear from you.
